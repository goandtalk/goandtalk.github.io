      <description>Go and Talk page builder stores data in IndexedDB, a feature offered by modern browsers. Each site or project is a unique database. Each page is a document in the database with a unique ID.
When a page loads, it checks for site id and page id from the URL query string. Site id defaults to &amp;lsquo;gt&amp;rsquo;, and page id defaults to the current path followed by _index.md. If custom page data is found, it renders the custom page data.</description>

      <description>In edit mode, Go and Talk page builder uses a template engine called doT to render blocks(sections) using data stored in browser. Each block is a Mavo app rendering user input dynamically. When the page is done, the same templates are used to render the sections without editor. The exported page is slim and loads faster.
Go and Talk page builder supports custom block template. You can define custom block template in site setting, insert new blocks and manage blocks in the same way.</description>

      <description>Go and Talk page builder uses a template engine called doT to render sections upon page loading, and to export a webpage when done. Custom delimiters and variables are used for doT to generate a slim web page without the burden of editor.
Go and Talk page builder supports custom export template for designers and developers to load libraries selectively, or to customize meta tags and scripts on the exported webpage.</description>

      <guid>https://builder.goandmake.app/demo/customizing-styles-and-fonts/</guid>
      <description>Go and Talk page builder uses Tachyons CSS to achieve flexible and modular designs. The utility classes take effect only when applied to an element. The element styles are reset to default when the classes are removed. This approach helps to keep the CSS slim even for complicated projects. Designers can style an element freely without worrying about breaking something else.
Go and Talk page builder supports inline style declaration and external CSS files.</description>

      <description>Global data is shared by pages of the same project. Each page can have its look and feel, with the same data, such as menu items.
Global section is a section with complete data and settings, such as a site wide call to action section. It can be inserted anywhere on a page, and rendered with the same data. This feature can be used to keep a bunch of commonly used blocks as global, and inserted on demand when you create new pages.</description>
